# The city you live in just finished construction of its new transport network, PlusRail. There are n stations and exactly one
# way to get between any given pair of them; this is because
# there are only n âˆ’ 1 direct station:station connections. In
# other words, the network forms a tree.
# You have been hired to put together the signage for each of
# the stations which shows where on the network a passenger
# is with a big arrow pointing to the bright red station in the
# centre.
