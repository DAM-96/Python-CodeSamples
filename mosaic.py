# Problem M. Mosaic Mansion
# Source file name: mosaic.c, mosaic.cpp, mosaic.java, mosaic.py
# Input: Standard
# Output: Standard
# A mosaic is a picture made from square tiles arranged in a grid, at least for todayâ€™s purposes.
# We would like to make a mosaic with exactly the same number of tiles of each colour. We will do this by
# taking an existing design and removing some of the rows from it.
# 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 3
# 5 2 5 3 5 5 5 5 1 4
# 2 3 2 1 4 3 3 2 1 4
# 1 2 3 4 4 4 4 1 2 3
# Figure M.1: Illustration of a solution to Example Input 1. The three rows annotated with white can be
# kept, giving 6 of each colour of tile.
# What is the greatest number of rows we can keep?
